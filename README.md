# Links

This was a simple website-building project completed over the course of the fall semester of 2016 at Wesleyan University for the course "Software Engineering" conducted by Professor Janet Burge.

The course, worth 1.5 credits, was structured as a learning + project class, in which we had an actual clients coming to students with the goal of having a website built for them. Our client was the Wesleyan Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and their concern was that they had a website that had a particular page that was just an immense collection of links to other sites and resources. They wanted a new website that could organize these links and make it possible for people to filter through them and search for whatever it is they wanted without having to scroll through a long page of just links.

We built a site using Ruby on Rails (and Ruby) that took the links data into a database and was accessible through SQL inputs. The site itself had built-in Wesleyan authentication that allowed for Wesleyan-affiliated users (@wesleyan.edu emails) to log in and rate particular links and add comments about the links. It organized the links into categories with drop-down features, and allowed users to filter by name, category, and keyword, and also search by name.

Built by a group of 4 students (Sangwon Kim, Joe Koshakow, Ethan Zornow, and Fletcher Liu), using an Agile software development cycle. Due to the nature of half the students graduating and myself leaving for the army in the summer, we were unable to continue working with the Patricelli Center to fully implement the site and is not a live website, but we received an A+ in the class for our project.
